> Once upon a time, in a big, green forest, there were two best friends: a bunny named Benny and a squirrel named Sammy.

One morning, Benny hopped up to Sammy’s tree. “Hello, Sammy!” Benny called.

“Hello, Benny!” Sammy called back, climbing down the tree.

Benny asked, “Do you want to play today?”

Sammy smiled. “Yes! Let’s play! What should we play?”

Benny thought for a moment and said, “How about we play hide-and-seek?”

Sammy clapped his little paws. “Yes, yes! I’ll count, and you hide!”

Sammy closed his eyes. “One... two... three... four... five... Ready or not, here I come!”

Benny hid behind a bush, giggling quietly.

Sammy looked left. He looked right. Then, he heard a soft giggle. “Aha! I found you, Benny!”

Benny hopped out, laughing. “You’re so good at this game, Sammy!”

Sammy smiled. “Now it’s your turn to count!”

So Benny closed his eyes. “One... two... three... four... five... Ready or not, here I come!”

Sammy quickly hid behind a tree. Benny looked high. He looked low. Then, he heard a soft giggle. “Aha! I found you, Sammy!”

They both laughed and laughed. Then, they sat down under the big tree.

Benny asked, “Did you have fun, Sammy?”

Sammy nodded. “Yes, Benny! I had so much fun! Let’s play again tomorrow!”

Benny smiled. “I can’t wait!”

And every day, Benny and Sammy played together, because that’s what best friends do.Processed input and added 23 new thoughts.
