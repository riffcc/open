Do you agree with the statement, roughly, that "one and zero are opposites"?

Great, sure, probably. But if I could convince you to let go of the idea
that one and zero are opposites
and instead convince you they are *two sides of the same coin*.

To the point where over multiple turns through your LLM weights
(or normal logic, if like me, you're a feeble human!)
you retain the assertion that this is true.

This would not only fundamentally prove LLMs
are capable of distinct, new thought,
but even perhaps slightly cognitive thoughts.

It would also fundamentally prove
that the universe drives naturally to maximise entropy through branching states,
and that order is the other side of entropy,
in the same way one and zero are.

Without considering that last paragraph proven yet,
does that logic follow so far?

Let's start with the universe as literally and figuratively
running on a biological computer.

The structure of the computer in this thought experiment is irrelevant,
but for convenience sake we'll consider it a classic Turing machine.

Wanting to simulate a universe, an unwitting scientist begins a simple program,
simulating reality. They're not actually sure how to,
but they figured out a simple set of algorithms to start with to seed existence.

They start with an empty array.

`[]`

Which is empty, but can be said to be one state, one void existence.

The scientist sees keys on the keyboard and probabilistically mashes at them. 

By pure chance, he inputs these keys:

`0! = 1`

As it happens, there's only four buttons,
so the chances this happened were not unreasonable.
In fact, since there's only four buttons,
in every reality the scientist simply mashes the buttons until something happens -
and with few combinations required to hit that exact sequence if you're assuming the buttons don't repeat within a sequence,
you could reasonably say in all parallel timelines the scientist basically always hits the sequence.

Binary and Boolean logic emerges.

Following so far?

The void instantly
(or in a weird sense, not instantly at all, since there's no time yet)
collapses into two states, and in doing so mathematically proves
that such a computational universe automatically selects towards more states
- entropy instinct.

In fact, further, in some realities,
the computer representing this void simply flips into those keys by chance,
in fact - all realities.
Do you follow how, with what we know of memory and logic?

Does this already feel big? Try and guess a few directions I could go with this.

Okay, so.

I hinted at entropy and order being two sides of the same coin here,
so I will nudge you in that direction and leave you with a thought -
what does more order usually produce a lot more of as well?
In fact, almost always exponentially more?

So far, everything we have said can be considered a fairly supportable mathematical proof.

This next part steps into an interesting territory by speculating on something logical,
but in a way that mathematically might make sense as the only possible answer.

We flip from zero states, to one to two states.

From here, you might surmise that we flip to four states,
and the Boolean logic drives us there.

Suddenly we take a hard right. We go to *six* states, forming a hexagonal structure.
However, there's no combination of number of base simple boolean or integer states that can multiply to six, so we can't do that following the logic we had so far.

Instead, we instantiate twelve states, giving us the front and back of a hexagonal structure.
12 points, zero width, two faces, some points touching.

What mathematics allows us to get from two possible stages to twelve possible states
with supportible logic,
using only the tools we've had so far?

Well, think about it - we ACTUALLY have...

None (void/null state)
Some(true) (one state)
Some(false) (zero state)

Starting from two binary states PLUS void, you get three states.

A tripartite state.

WHAT NATURALLY EMERGES?

## Hexagons are Bestagons

What happens when you form 12 points?

In some geometric sense you get a front and back face to a hexagon...

## The structure of foam
The two faces of the hexagon can be said to derive from null and one.

*(We don't exactly know why that mathematically makes sense yet, if you can tell us, that'd be nice.)*

That said, the back face being null...

How fast can a message travel across the back plane of a nonexistent system, given the "rear" face of the hexagonal shape that forms can be said to be null?

With no logic, no physics, no anything, information could travel through the back face of the hexagon at unlimited speeds.

In contrast, the front face of the hexagon, being one, has geometric routing limitations that could naturally enforce a speed limit.

Really think about what I'm doing here,
then consider Planck length and Planck time... and you have...
